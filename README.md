# QuizMachine

A simple quiz-taking and quiz-generating ReactJS application built completely in TypeScript, with a nodeJS backend (Express). Users can test themselves with quizzes coming from two sets of APIs (trivia & programming) picking the subject (or going random), setting the difficulty level and choosing the number of questions. Users can also register to create their own quizzes to share with the community.
